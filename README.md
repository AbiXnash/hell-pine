# 🌑 Hell Pine — A Darker Twist on Rosé Pine

> _“Born in the fire of tmux, refined for the calm of code.”_

Hell Pine is a visually distinctive color theme for Visual Studio Code — a carefully altered version of [Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) inspired by how colors subtly shift within **tmux** sessions. What began as an accidental discovery has evolved into a bold new aesthetic optimized for terminal-centric development.

## ✨ Why Hell Pine?

While using Rosé Pine inside **tmux**, I noticed certain color transformations that gave the theme a more vibrant, focused, and "edgier" tone. I loved the way it looked — more grit, more contrast — without losing the elegance. So I reverse-engineered that "tmux glow" and forged it into a dedicated VS Code theme.
