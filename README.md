# 🌑 Hell Pine — A Darker Twist on Rosé Pine

> _“Born in the fire of tmux, refined for the calm of code.”_

**Hell Pine** is a bold, terminal-inspired dark theme for Visual Studio Code — a meticulously crafted evolution of [Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/), born from the nuanced visual shifts experienced within **tmux** sessions. What began as a subtle observation became a deliberate design — optimized for developers who live in the terminal and demand both beauty and clarity in their workflow.

> This is Rosé Pine after going through hell... and coming back beautiful.

## ✨ Why Hell Pine?

While working with Rosé Pine inside `tmux`, I discovered unexpected but aesthetically pleasing color distortions — deeper shadows, punchier highlights, and an overall sharper contrast. It felt raw yet refined — and I knew it deserved to be more than a glitch.

**Hell Pine** is my response — a theme that retains the elegance of Rosé Pine while infusing it with terminal grit and expressive contrast. The result is a developer-centric palette perfect for long coding sessions, especially in split-pane, multi-window environments.
